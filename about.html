      <h3>I moved to the UK from South Africa many moons ago. I love it here, but was still hankering for a taste of 'home' every now and then. Nothing tastes more like South Africa than biltong!</h2>

      <br>

      <h3>I found the price of buying biltong in the UK prohibitively expensive, so decided to build a couple of 'drying units' using large plastic storage boxes, PC cooling fans and wooden dowels. This worked a treat, and I was churning out great tasting biltong on a regular basis! This was purely for personal consumption, but word soon got out...</h2>

      <br>

      <h3>Some British friends requested I make some biltong for them too, and it soon dawned on me that this uniquely South African snack has universal appeal. I was making and selling large amounts of biltong for much less than the average cost, and it really grew from there.</h2>

      <br>

      <h3>I started making biltong with respect for the process, and the philosophy is still the same. It takes time and patience, but the reward is a delicious hand-made snack, with no MSG's or preservatives.
      </h3>
