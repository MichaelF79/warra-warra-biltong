    <h1>What is biltong?</h1>

    <br>

    <h3>Biltong is a dried and cured meat delicacy. It is whole cuts of meat (mostly cut from the silverside in the case of beef) that is cured with vinegar and salt, spiced to taste, then naturally air-dryed.

    <h1>Biltong and jerky is NOT the same...</h1>

          <h3>Although Biltong would be the winner in the eyes of a South African, we thought it would be useful to set the record straight once and for all! Jerky and Biltong are different, but what is the difference?

          <br>
          <br>

          Biltong and Jerky are similar in that they are both dried meats, the taste and the production process is different. Biltong originates from South Africa, whereas Jerky originates from North and South America.

          <br>
          <br>

          In terms of texture, there is a vast difference! Biltong is, in its basic form, a dried steak, which is then cut to eat. This means you can have it wet or ‘rare’, medium, or hard ‘well done’ biltong.
          However, as jerky is cut then dehydrated anywhere from 3-8 hours, it makes for an overall drier product.Jerky can also be made from either whole meat or minced meat.

          <br>
          <br>

          Biltong is traditionally marinated in vinegar and spices that add extra flavour to the meat. While jerky often has a dry and smoky taste. This is the key difference, Biltong is hung and air dried, while jerky is cooked on a rack.

          <br>
          <br>

          The word “jerky” has grown to include a wide variety of dehydrated foods. You can now find companies marketing mushroom jerky, cactus jerky, clam jerky, soy jerky, coconut jerky and bacon jerky. Biltong, however, remains limited to red meats, based on its ageing process and limited ingredients. The most popular being beef biltong, venison biltong and ostrich biltong.
